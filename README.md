# Book-Insights-Project

A personal data and QA engineering project that uses a fictional bookstore database to showcase skills in Python, SQL, data cleaning, and analysis.

## Project Description

This project simulates a small independent bookstore using real book data of all the books I have read that I have tracked on Goodreads and fake customers and purchase data generated with Python.

I created:

- A clean database that includes the books, customers, and purchases table
- SQL tables created both manually and programmatically
- Data quality testing and error simulation to mimic real-world inconsistencies
- Future plans for analyzing trends in book purchases, genres, and customer behavior

## Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, SQLite, Faker)
- SQL (SQLite + MySQL)
- GitHub for version control
